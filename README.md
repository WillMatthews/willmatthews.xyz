# willmatthews.xyz site infrastructure

## Technologies Used

- hakyll
- sass (hakyll-sass)

## Plans

This will replace my existing site, which is made in hugo.
My current site is far too bloated and rubbish, I feel like I need a change.
There is a certain virtue in making it all very lightweight.

I plan on building it ALL up from the bottom, style and all.

This will also be treated as a learning experience to develop my haskell skills (the blade has seriously dulled).

## Timeline
New blog will be up before the end of 2024.


2024:

- March: Basic Prototype of site running
- April: Finish Styling
- May: Improve usability (see gwern.net sidenotes etc)
- June: Add embeddings, semantic search, etc.
- July: Publications as HTML
